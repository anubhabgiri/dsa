# Dynamic Programming Notes

## Overview
Dynamic programming can be solved by:
- Iterating through the input
- Recursively calling a function 

## Propagation Methods
Some problems can be solved by:
- **Forward Propagation**
- **Backward Propagation**: In case of backward propagation, it is required to use recursive calls.

## Approaches
- **Bottom-Up Approach**: The iterative method is known as the bottom-up approach.
- **Top-Down Approach**: The recursive method is known as the top-down approach.

## Complexity
Generally, the bottom-up approach has less space complexity and overhead.
